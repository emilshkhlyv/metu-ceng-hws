###TAKE HOME EXAM 2 – QUICKSORT & 3-WAY QUICKSORT

```int QuickSort (int*& arr, int size, bool ascending);```

```int QuickSort3 (int*& arr, int size, bool ascending);```

In this exam, you are asked to sort the given array $arr$ with two different sorting algorithms namely Quick Sort and 3-Way Quick Sort ascending or descending depending on the boolean variable $ascending$ and return the number of number comparisons (comparisons between the values to be sorted only, not your auxiliary comparisons) done in each of the algorithm.

Details of the algorithms can be seen in links below:

IMPORTANT: In your implementations, always choose the rightmost element as pivot.

Constraints: Array sizes are less than 10^5 for both algorithms (and > 0)
