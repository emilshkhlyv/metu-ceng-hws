# How to run my code:
You should type corresponding lines in different terminals
For running server.py:
	python3 127.0.0.1 15592 15593
	
For running client.py:
	python3 127.0.0.1 15592 15593 15594 15595
	
# What did I do for doing this homework
Because of the midterm held this week I read and prepared for all the concepts, after that I learnt how to do socket programming in python3.

# How did I plan what to do
Firstly I planned to do TCP part. Afterwards I started to do UDP part. Because RDT I know that, UDP part is more challenging than TCP part.

# Which problems did I face
I started to do this assignment yesterday. So time was a big problem for me. Other than time because of os and python3 , sometimes ports do not work appropriately. 

# What did I learn after the study
I learnt how to do socket programming in python3 and differences between UDP and TCP implementation.

# How many days did it take
I did this homework in nearly 1 day.
6 hours for TCP part
7 hours for UDP part.

# RDT protocol
I used Go-Back-N algortihm in this assignment. I used md5 hashcode for checksum control.
