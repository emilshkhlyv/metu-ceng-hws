1. knn
For running knn algorithm you can enter the command "python3 knn_main.py".
This command will produce the plot of average accuracies with respect to corresponding k values and print the suitable k value and its accuracy, which is obtained by using that k on test dataset.

2. k-means
For running kmeans algorithm you can enter the command "python3 kmeans_main.py".
In that file there's main function and several helper functions for plotting purposes, initializing center purposes and etc.
Function "main_for_elbow(cluster)" is for plotting the elbow method on the given cluster.
Function "main_for_clustering(cluster, k)" is for plotting the resultant cluster of the given cluster with given k value.

3. HAC
For running hac algorithm you can enter the command "python3 hac_main.py".
In that file there's main function and you can change the arguments of hac function and run and get plot of that configuration.
